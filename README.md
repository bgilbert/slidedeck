SlideDeck
---------

This is a simple web application for viewing whole-slide images.  Point
it at a directory tree and it will serve all the slide files it finds there.
Slides can be added and removed from the directory tree without restarting
the web server.

SlideDeck uses OpenSlide to read the slide files and OpenSeadragon to display
them.
